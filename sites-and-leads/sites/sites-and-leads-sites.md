Welcome to the **Sites & Leads** user guide for the **TourSolver Mobile application**! This guide is designed to help you efficiently access and explore customer leads, empowering you to stay organized, efficient, and informed during your daily field operations. Whether you're a new user or looking to master advanced features, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know.

### Getting Started

The TourSolver Mobile application's **Sites & Leads** feature simplifies managing customer information and optimizing your field tasks.

* **System Requirements:** The provided sources do not specify system requirements for the TourSolver Mobile application.
* **Installation/Setup Steps:** The provided sources do not include steps for installing or setting up the TourSolver Mobile application.
* **Initial Configuration:** The sources indicate that **leads are secondary customer locations already stored in the database**. They can have records that are either assigned or not assigned to your current route. The application automatically optimizes routes, so the distance shown is for information only, not for further optimization.

### Feature Explanations with Benefits

The **Sites & Leads** feature offers a robust way to manage customer interactions:

* **Customer Sites**: These are customer locations assigned to the current route
* **Detailed Order Cards**: Each customer order card displays essential information at a glance, including the customer’s name, address, email ID, phone number, and current location.
* **Real-time Updates**: When you tap on a customer card, you can access detailed information that includes real-time updates of the customer's order, location, and any specific preferences like delivery instructions. You’ll also see estimated distance, estimated travel time, the territory of the lead, contacts, and linked documents.
* **Optimized Routes**: The application comes with routes that are already optimized, meaning the displayed distance is purely for your information.
* **Efficient Field Operations**: Features like smart filters and integrated navigation are designed to support your daily tasks, helping you stay organized, efficient, and well-informed.
