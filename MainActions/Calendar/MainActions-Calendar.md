### 4. Productivity Tips

ðŸ’¡ The calendar screen is designed to help you quickly see and manage interventions for any date, today or in the future.

*   **Stay Updated:** Regularly use the **"Update my agenda"** feature (found under the **filter button > Actions**) to ensure your calendar reflects the latest changes from your planner. This is crucial for accurate scheduling.
*   **Quick Search:** If you need to find a specific intervention, don't scroll endlessly! Use the **"Search for an intervention"** tool (also under **filter button > Actions**) to quickly locate it by typing a name, number, date, or address.
*   **Visual Planning:** Leverage the **Map View** to understand your daily route and the geographical distribution of your interventions. This can help you anticipate travel times and optimize your sequence of visits.
*   **Status at a Glance:** Familiarize yourself with the **color legend** for intervention statuses. This allows for rapid identification of accepted, in-progress, completed, or other statuses without needing to tap into each card.
