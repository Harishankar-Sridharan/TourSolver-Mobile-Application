### Understanding Interventions and Abandonment

In TourSolver Mobile, an "intervention" refers to a task or activity you need to complete. Sometimes, circumstances change, and you might need to cancel or "abandon" an intervention you've started or were about to begin. This guide will walk you through the simple steps to do just that.

### Common Task: Abandoning an Intervention

Before you start a new intervention or abandon an existing one, it's crucial to ensure that you have completed any interventions currently marked as "in progress". You must finish all ongoing interventions before moving on to the next one.

Here’s how to abandon an intervention in TourSolver Mobile:

1. **Access the Intervention from Your Dashboard**
   * To begin, you need to open the specific intervention you wish to abandon.
