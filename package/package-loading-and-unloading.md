### **3. Common Tasks**

This section provides detailed steps for the most common tasks you'll perform in the Package-Loading and Unloading module.

#### **3.1 Managing Packages in the Loading Tab**

The Loading tab is where you manage packages scheduled for delivery.

1.  **Viewing Package Details**:
    *   In the **Loading tab**, you can see important details on each package card, such as the loaded date and time, the package name, and customer information.

![GIF at 0:58–1:06](../../images/Package-Loading and Unloading_timestamp_0_to_58–1_to_06.gif "Interface state – Key details visible on package card.")


2.  **Scanning a Barcode**:
    *   This is the primary way to confirm a package's status.

![GIF at 1:06–1:11](../../images/Package-Loading and Unloading_timestamp_1_to_06–1_to_11.gif "Action – Tap the Scan icon.")

    2.  Position your device to scan the package's barcode.

![GIF at 1:06–1:24](../../images/Package-Loading and Unloading_timestamp_1_to_06–1_to_24.gif "GIF at 1:06–1:24")


3.  **Using the Flashlight (Torch Icon)**:
    *   If a barcode is hard to see due to poor lighting or is invisible, you can turn on your device's flashlight.

![GIF at 1:24–1:31](../../images/Package-Loading and Unloading_timestamp_1_to_24–1_to_31.gif "Action – Tap the Torch icon at the top to enable the flashlight.")

![GIF at 1:24–1:36](../../images/Package-Loading and Unloading_timestamp_1_to_24–1_to_36.gif "GIF at 1:24–1:36")


4.  **Manually Entering a Barcode (Keyboard Icon)**:
    *   If a barcode is damaged and cannot be scanned, you can manually enter its code.

![GIF at 1:36–1:43](../../images/Package-Loading and Unloading_timestamp_1_to_36–1_to_43.gif "Action – Tap the Keyboard icon at the bottom to enter code manually.")

    2.  Enter the barcode number using the keyboard that appears.

5.  **Adding Comments to a Package**:
    *   You can add notes or comments to a package, which can be useful for providing additional information.
    1.  Tap on a specific **package card** in the **Loading tab**.
    2.  Scroll down to the **comment section**.
    3.  Tap on the text box within the comment section to enter your comments.
        *   *Screenshot/Diagram Suggestion*: A screenshot of the comment section with the package details (loaded date/time, package name above; customer name/address below) would be helpful here.
    4.  You'll see details like loaded date and time, and package name above the comment box. Below it, you'll find the customer name and customer address.

### **4. Productivity Tips**

Here are some tips to help you get the most out of the TourSolver Mobile App:

*   💡 **Confirm Scans Instantly**: Always look for the **green circle** on the package card after scanning. This quickly confirms a successful scan, saving you time.
*   💡 **Use the Flashlight Wisely**: If you're in a dimly lit area or dealing with a faded barcode, don't hesitate to use the **Torch icon** to enable your flashlight. It can save you from manual entry.
*   💡 **Know When to Manually Enter**: For severely damaged barcodes, the **Keyboard icon** is your best friend. It ensures you can still process the package accurately even if a scan isn't possible.
*   ⚠️ **Always Save Your Changes**: Whether you're entering a barcode manually or adding photos, remember to tap the **Save button** to ensure your updates are recorded. Forgetting to save means your work won't be applied!
*   💡 **Navigate Efficiently**: Use the **X icon** to quickly exit pages and the **Back button** to return to previous screens. Knowing these navigation tools will make your workflow smoother.
*   💡 **Add Comments for Clarity**: Utilize the comment sections for both loading and unloading packages. This is a great way to record specific details, customer requests, or reasons for returns, providing valuable context for yourself and others.
