## Understanding Loading and Unloading

The TourSolver Mobile App helps you manage packages for delivery and returns efficiently.

### Loading Tab Functions

The **Loading** tab is where you manage packages that need to be delivered to customers.

* You can view essential details for each package directly on its **package card**, such as:
  * **Loaded date and time**
  * **Package name**
  * **Customer information**

### Unloading Tab Functions

The **Unloading** tab is used for two main purposes:

* Displaying packages that have been **returned to the warehouse** (for example, due to customer unavailability).
* Managing parcels that you have **picked up from a customer**.
* On an intervention card in the Unloading tab, you can view:
  * **Loaded and unloaded date and time**
  * **Package name**
  * **Customer name**
  * **Customer address**

## Common Tasks and How to Perform Them

Here are detailed steps for common tasks you'll perform in the app.

### 1. Scanning Barcodes (Loading & Unloading)

Scanning barcodes is a primary way to manage packages in both the Loading and Unloading tabs.

## Productivity Tips

* **Quick Status Check**: Always check the **Parcel icon's color** (blue, red, yellow) for a fast overview of your parcel statuses without needing to open each package card.
* **Use Flashlight for Tricky Barcodes**: Don't waste time trying to scan in poor lighting. The **Torch icon** is there to help!
* **Manual Entry for Damaged Codes**: If a barcode is unreadable, use the **Keyboard icon** to manually enter the code quickly and avoid delays.
* **Add Comments and Photos**: For returned or picked-up packages, detailed comments and photos can be crucial for record-keeping and avoiding future issues.
